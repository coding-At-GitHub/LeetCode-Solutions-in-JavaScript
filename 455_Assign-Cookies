/*
455. Assign Cookies
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. 
If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. 
Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

 * @param {number[]} g
 * @param {number[]} s
 * @return {number}

var findContentChildren = function(g, s) {
    let compare = function(a, b) {return b - a};
    g.sort(compare);
    s.sort(compare);
    let j = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < g.length; i++) {
        if (g[i] <= s[j]) j++;
    }
    return j;
